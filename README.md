## What is this?

A way to show, and let people play with, beautiful science!

## Can I fork it?

Please do. And let me know if you want to! I'd be happy to put it into a form that'll be easier for you to deal with.

Its node requirements are https, express, and socket.io. I know I'm supposed to say that using a package.json but it was giving me bugs. Sorry.
